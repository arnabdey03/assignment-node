# assignment-node
This is a assignment project made with node js, express, jwt and mysql.

Please rename .env.example to .env and specify database details of your actual database credentials, the details that are mentioned there is for example purpose only.

Also please update AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN_SECRET value with a more secure and complex value and the update the port number to your desired port in the .env file.

The database I used in my local system is present in the assignment.sql file, feel free to use that or you can also use own database and tables and map those accordingly with the app.

A request.rest file is also added for reference, I used it for testing the APIs with the Rest Client extension on VS Code

Thanks..
